Updated JEDI-Pascal-Headers for SDL
-----------------------------------

I've updated the JEDI-Headers for the newer Delphi-Versions and defined a special-dll-name for 64-Bit - there's a 64-bit-dll version of the SDL.dll on libsdl.org now, download them and rename "SDL.dll" to "SDL64.dll" to use it.
